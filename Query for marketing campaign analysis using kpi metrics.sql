	Creating a Sample from the CTE
 From the resulting CTE, created a sample with:

-utm_campaign extracted from the utm_parameters field.
-Used the substring function with a regular expression to handle the extraction.
-Calculated the total amount of expenses, number of impressions, number of clicks, and total conversion value for each date and campaign.
-Computed CTR(click through rate), CPC(cost per click), CPM(cost per mile), 
and ROMI(return of marketing investment) for each date and campaign,
